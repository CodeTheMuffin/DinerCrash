- Pixel Perfect Camera:
A Unity package. Go to main camera. Add component -> Pixel Perfect Camera. 
In the newly added component, make PPU (pixel per unit) the desired amount (ie 8 to represent 8 pixels per unit) 
Change reference resolution to 64 pixels by 64 pixels or desired resolution
CHECK the check box for 'Upscale Render Texture'.
CHECK the check boxes for 'Crop Frame' for BOTH X and Y
UNCHECK the check box for STRETCH FILL (this would leave weird blurring effect when screen is upscaled)
Can press 'Run in Edit Mode' to see how it would look in a given resolution/ratio (ie. 16:9 or 1920 x 1080)

Additonal tip:
- Edit Grid snap settings:
	- Goto Edit -> Grid and Snap settings (last item in drop down)
	- As stated in the link below, change the Increment Snap Move X and Y to 1/ your game's PPU
		- For example, my PPU is 8. So my Increment Snap Move for X and Y would be 1/8 = 0.125
	- You could do the same for the World Grid Size value or leave at 1 for X/Y/Z
- Crisp Pixel sprites (apply to each sprite):
	- Click desired pixel sprite. Change PPU from 100 (default) to desired amount (ie. 8).
	- Change Filter Mode from Bilinear '(default)' to 'Point (no filter)'.
	- All the way at the bottom, it would show 'Default' then all the different platforms you are building towards.
		- Go to the 'Default' tab, and change Compression from 'Normal Quality' (default) to 'None'
	- Once you have done all the above, press 'Apply'.
	- And now your pixel art would be sharp and crisp!!
	- Unforunately you have to do this for ALL sprites... wish there was a way to default this....
